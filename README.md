## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Basic Javascript

### What I learned

During this challenge I learned a lot of new Javascript objects and methods like .forEach(), .addEventListener(), etc.I have not mastered them yet but I will and use them more efficiently in future in more projects.

### Continued development

The working of this site is not very efficient and it could break very easily at so many points but still it completes the challenge.So I will let it be for now but will definetly improve in further in future when I will be more comapatible with JS.
